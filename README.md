Welcome to the repository for the dose-response relationship of LSD-induced subjective experiences in humans.

Files contain analysis and plotting commands for each scale or factor of the respective questionnaire. 
Psychometric data are provided in excel-files. 

Included study data were identified with a systematic literature search (see Prugger et al. 2022) combined with data of the Altered States Database by Timo T. Schmidt (www.asdb.info).

This study is currently under peer review and soon to be published.
